# Machine-Learning-Notes

**This repository is mainly for keeping my machine learning notes, they are mainly some mathematical fundamentals and background about the proposed background of various models and their mathematical derivations.**

**This repository will be continuously updated, so far the mathematical basics include matrix derivation methods, and specific models include Bayesian networks and Gaussian mixture models.**
